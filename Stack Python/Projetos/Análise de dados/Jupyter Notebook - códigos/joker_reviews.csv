                    ""Joker"" a lovely homage to films of a previous era and a subversive take on the ""formula"" of superhero/comic-book media.
                ","
                    If cinema's job is to make us feel, to make us reflect upon how we've been living life, and to acknowledge some of its own brand of crazy, then I think Joker did a damn good job.
                ","
                    It's a disappointing film only because it could have been so much better.
                ","
                    [Phoenix as the Joker] burns like he were an archangel on heroin, a contorted otherworldly presence that under a different constellation of stars would have ended up a saint.
                ","
                    Ultimately, Joker is neither deserving of the controversy it's stirred up nor some of the praise it's received. Phoenix's performance is the highlight of what is ultimately a relatively tame film.

                    An instant classic that sees Joaquin Phoenix translate a discombobulating sensation from the screen to your senses, while director Todd Phillips creates a melancholic psychodrama...
                ","
                    A male rage manifesto with ugly societal truths.
                ","
                    Although it has some of the hallmarks of a mainstream movie, there's little that's entertaining about Joker. Phoenix's version of the character is uncomfortable, and his off-putting nature will likely not inspire many repeat viewings.
                ","
                    It may not be a deep or realistic study of mental illness but it showcases Arthur's weariness at being treated as the cigarette butt under society's heel.
                ","
                    Joker is nothing more than a shallow homunculus of better films.
                ","
                    Phoenix gives the performance of his career, one already filled with admirable, transformative performances. But this one is different. This one is his cry for Oscar gold, and the masses will surely be chanting his name and singing his praises on high.
                ","
                    ... this is an R-rated origin story for one of the most deranged, murderous villains in fiction, and the film reflects that. It may not make you feel good, but it will make you feel something, and sometimes that's enough.
                ","
                    Surely the most realistic depiction of a supervillain becoming a supervillain thus far.
                ","
                    Joker is a subversion of the trope of the hero's journey, made for a villain.
                ","
                    Without Mr. Phoenix, Joker would be kind of dull.
                ","
                    Joker is repulsive, cynical garbage that tries acting more meaningful than it actually is.
                ","
                    Joker is a one-man show...the riot scenes near the end of Joker reflect something true in society, and they brought the film out of its shell.
                ","
                    It's one of 2019's most unforgettable cinematic experiences.
                ","
                    A comic book movie with sufficient creative liberty to become a psychological thriller that talks about the darkest feelings of human reality. [Full review in Spanish]

                    Repellent and pitiful at the same time, Phoenix is absolutely riveting.
